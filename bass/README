The Bass component is used for backing up files from student submissions. Bass
should be run on a physically separate machine from the Conductor. It reaches
out to the conductor periodically to back up any runs that have completed since
the last backup (i.e. these are incremental backups).

Bass configuration is simple. Running the setup.sh script will add a CRON entry
for Bass that runs every night at 3am local time. Bass will store all back ups
in the bass/backups folder.

The only requirements for proper Bass operation are that it have SSH credentials
on the Conductor host, and that those credentials be properly configured through
the setup.sh script.
