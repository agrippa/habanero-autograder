     | lightweight-java-profiler should be installed on the remote cluster, and an
     | environment variable named LIGHTWEIGHT_JAVA_PROFILER_HOME pointed to its
     | root directory.
 - JUnit 4.x or higher

     | the environment variable JUNIT_JAR pointed to the main jar file.
 - Hamcrest-core 1.3
     | Should be installed on the remote compute cluster and the Viola host,
     | with the environment variable HAMCREST_JAR pointed to the core jar file.
 - RoadRunner v0.3
     | Should be installed on the remote compute cluster, with the environment
     | variable RR_AGENT_JAR pointed to the agent JAR file and RR_RUNTIME_JAR
     | pointed to the runtime JAR file.
 - AUTOGRADER_HOME
     | This environment variable must be set everywhere (node server, Viola
     | server, cluster) to the root autograder directory.
 - jshint
     | sudo npm install -g jshint

===== postgres installation instructions =====

On RedHat, follow the instructions at http://www.if-not-true-then-false.com/2012/install-postgresql-on-fedora-centos-red-hat-rhel/. Create an 'autograder' database instead of a 'test' database. Set the password of postgres as necessary. Then run the setup.sql script.

 2. apt-get install postgresql-contrib
 3. sudo -u postgres psql postgres
    a. \password postgres
    b. Set the postgres user's password (e.g. "foobar")

 4. Create the autograder database:
    a. sudo -u postgres createdb autograder
 5. To restart server:
    a. sudo /etc/init.d/postgresql restart
 6. To login to the autograder database:
    a. sudo -u postgres psql --username=postgres --dbname=autograder
    b. \l to list all databases (this should show autograder)
    c. \dt to list all tables in the current database (should be empty now)
 7. Configure the database, the command to use varies from platform to platform, e.g.:
    a. sudo -u postgres psql --username=postgres --dbname=autograder --file=setup.sql
    b. /Applications/Postgres.app/Contents/Versions/9.4/bin/psql --username=jmg3 --dbname=autograder --file=setup.sql
