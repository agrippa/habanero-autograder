1. Using SVN as a content management system has its benefits in terms of
   consistency, accessibility, simplicity but it also seems to not respond well
   to heavy loads, e.g. if 100 submissions occur simultaneously either it or the
   svn-spawn library I am using tend to simply hang while creating the SVN
   directories to store the submissions. Should consider a restructuring around
   some alternative.
